# Consistent Hashing: An Objective Implementation Guide

Consistent hashing is a strategy designed to distribute data across multiple **nodes** or **shards** in a distributed system efficiently. It minimizes the redistribution of data when nodes are added or removed, improving scalability and availability.

## Why Use Consistent Hashing?

- **Scalability**: Facilitates easy scaling of the system by adding or removing nodes with minimal data movement.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensures even data distribution and load balancing across all nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enhances system's fault tolerance and availability.

## How Consistent Hashing Works

- Maps both nodes and data keys to a circular hash space, termed as the hash ring.
- Data keys are assigned to the closest node in the clockwise direction on the hash ring.
- Virtual nodes are used to enhance load balancing and fault tolerance.

## Implementation Considerations

### Hash Space Size

- **Objective**: Select a hash space size that aligns with the system's scale and optimizes for collision reduction and resource efficiency.

### Scenario Examples

#### Scenario A: Small to Medium Systems

- **Nodes/Shard**: 100
- **Total Shards**: Up to 3
- **Total Nodes**: 300
- **Recommended Hash Space**: 1024 (2^10)
  - **Rationale**: Offers a balance between granularity and overhead, suitable for up to 300 nodes.

#### Scenario B: Larger Systems

- **Nodes/Shard**: 1000
- **Total Shards**: Up to 20
- **Total Nodes**: 20000
- **Recommended Hash Space**: 32768 (2^15)
  - **Rationale**: Provides a larger hash space to reduce collisions and maintain even distribution with a higher node count.

### Key Points

- **Power of Two**: Hash space sizes that are powers of two are preferred for computational efficiency.
- **Collision Reduction**: A primary goal is minimizing collisions to ensure even load distribution.
- **Balance**: The hash space size should balance the trade-off between underutilization and system overhead.

## Example Calculations

- **Small to Medium System**: With 300 nodes and a 1024-slot hash space, each node covers approximately 3.4 slots, facilitating even distribution.
- **Larger System**: With 20000 nodes and a 32768-slot hash space, each node is responsible for about 1.6 slots, decreasing collision chances while optimizing resource use.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right hash space size is critical in consistent hashing implementations, affecting collision rates, system overhead, and distribution uniformity. Starting with a hash space of 1024 (2^10) for smaller systems and scaling to 32768 (2^15) for larger setups offers a practical framework. Adjustments may be needed based on performance observations and specific system requirements, keeping the primary objectives of scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance in focus.
